December 25, 1867.--I will never forget what Madame Pamphile told me this morning about Charles X.","It is dangerous to mix up emotions and language. Even a few words may mean different things to different people. * * * * * Love is a great thing, isn't it, and men love it more than they can say. How much greater it is than they can understand, I know, but still it is the most wonderful of all the great things. * * * * * Nothing is more exciting, I know, than love in action.","beam,nucleus",pg19,t5_xxl_descartes,"Text 1.

The poetry had more import to Godwin than to Wordsworth; and as, in Godwin’s opinion, the one is made to outweigh the other in significance, it would be wholly false of him to infer that Wordsworth is more lovable to him.

GODWIN AND WORDSWORTH (Reprinted from _The Pilot_, 20th April 1901. With added postscript.)","In 1894, The English Bookseller, London, published a fine collection of 200 Poems by and about Wordsworth. Throughout the book are reproduced the heads of the various books that he had edited for that magazine, and at the end are the poems of those books. In the piece quoted here the ‘poems’ and ‘words’ are in his proper order. This was added at the Editor’s request. ‘The Heavens,’ in his Poems, was published in 1891.","As the intimates of the two great poets, they are most interesting to compare. While Godwin congratulated Wordsworth on a great collection of poems, yet he was no lover of the poet. The poetry had more import to Godwin than to Wordsworth; and as, in Godwin’s opinion, the one is made to outweigh the other in significance, it would be wholly false of him to infer that Wordsworth is more lovable to him. Godwin’s system of poetry has a far larger scope than Wordsworth’s.","nucleus,beam",pg19,t5_xxl_descartes,"Text 2.

At Windsor he was agreeable to the Queen from his German tastes and sympathies, not to mention the fact that he could speak German as fluently as English. Every moment of leisure during his ""wait"" there was spent in the Castle library. Yet the position was an unnatural one, and Lord Acton soon became anxious to escape from it. His thoughts turned to his favourite Bavaria, and he humbly suggested the Legation at Stuttgart as a possible sphere. But something infinitely better than any political or diplomatic post remained for this born student and truly learned man. In 1895, just a year after Mr. Gladstone's resignation, Sir John Seeley, Professor of Modern History at Cambridge, departed this life. The Chair was in the gift of the Crown, that is, of the Prime Minister, and Lord Rosebery appointed Lord Acton. The appointment was singularly felicitous, and the opportunity came in the nick of time.","The Fourth Coalition had reached its head, and a political crisis in the Old Empire was imminent. Acton occupied the Chair and the whole atmosphere of the College was changed. In the early days of his appointment the great historian took a more active part in College affairs, although he continued essentially to be an eccentric and reclusive student and teacher. He has often expressed himself in terms of gratitude to his predecessor, Sir John Seeley, as a most unusual and kind man. And the goodwill that Lord Acton received among his students at Cambridge had a permanent bearing on his subsequent career.","Lord Acton had become restless in Windsor and was anxious to find a better sphere.

The Mongol command at Yunnan now deemed the imperial order to withdraw void, and ordered an invasion of central Burma. They may not have reached Pagan, and even if they did, after having suffered heavy casualties, they returned to Tagaung. The Pagan Empire disintegrated and anarchy ensued. The Mongols, who probably preferred the situation, did nothing to restore order in the next ten years. In March 1297, they accepted the voluntary submission of King Kyawswa of Pagan although he controlled little beyond the capital city of Pagan (Bagan). But Kyawswa was overthrown nine months later, and the Mongols were forced to intervene, leading to their second invasion in 1300–01.","As the Mongols approached Bagan, Burmese commanders launched a desperate attack that lasted two years. During this invasion the Mongols suffered casualties estimated at between 30,000 and 40,000. After their second invasion, the Mongols were unable to contain Burmese revolts for another fifteen years until Naung Eziaw’s Third Pagan revolt ended in 1332 with the restoration of an independent Burmese state. Following the Mongol invasion of Bagan in 1300, the country went into a period of renewed instability.","The Mongols returned to China with a significant following. Burmese history does not know much about them after their withdrawal. It seems that the British Colonial Office took over the land they had occupied in the early 19th century, and took it from the Burmese in 1921–22. They kept an outpost near Pagan for the next fifty years. With the French, Britain established trading posts in Burma in the 16th century. These remained in Burma until the late 18th century. As a result, the Burmese have been denied access to their past history.","beam,nucleus",wiki,t5_xxl_descartes,"Text 1.

This was achieved by the donation of labour, plant, materials or grants of money, or by giving discounts for materials purchased or providing publicity for the project. A four-storey tower mill with Common sails carried on a wooden windshaft, driving two pairs of overdrift millstones. Brake wheel diameter. Winding was by hand. The four-storey tower is built of brick, and stands from ground level to the curb. The walls are thick at ground level. The mill is described from the top down. The pepperpot cap sits on top of the tower, giving the mill an overall height of to the finial. It houses the cast-iron windshaft and diameter wooden brake wheel internally.

The eight bladed fantail keeps the mill turned into wind.","The tower is surmounted by a distinctive 3 metre (16 ft) tall chimney. This is glazed to the top and sides and has three opening 'windows' above. The tower is clad with linen sheets and chestnut pickets. Its height is much reduced from top to bottom.

This connects to a cast-iron friction wheel with a diameter kerb wheel and contains the overdrift millstones.","Two pairs of overdrift millstones are mounted on shafts at either end of the two pairs of sails. The two top pairs of millstones are cast iron, about 6 inches in diameter and 20 inches long. The lower pair are in bronze. Aside from the largest diameter shaft, the mill's internal structure consists of wooden beams and rafters. The internal walls are , much thicker than those on the outer walls.

The Curators of the Parks, not less generous to the birds than to mankind, have provided vast stores of food for the former, in the numbers of birches and conifers which flourish under their care. They, or their predecessors who stocked the plantations, seem to have had the particular object of attracting those delightful little north-country birds the Lesser Redpolls, for they have planted every kind of tree in whose seeds they find a winter subsistence. Whether they come every winter I am unable to say, and am inclined to doubt it; but in 1884, any one who went the round of the Parks, keeping an eye on the birches, could hardly fail to see them, and they have been reported not only as taking refuge here in the winter, but even as nesting in the summer. A nest was taken from the branch of a fir-tree here in 1883, and in this present year, if I am not mistaken, another nest was built.","If these little birds come in the summer, they must come to the Parks every year. The quantities of birches are only small compared with the numbers of conifers and the ground-covering plants, but the Redpolls, like the Woodpeckers, will favour any plantation which provides a winter supply of seed. The colours of the birches are very beautiful, varying from soft pink to bold reds. In winter these trees are rich with greenish cones, which the Redpolls feed upon, and which we see all over England. Fig. 22.","In the same neighbourhood two pairs were reported in the same month; but the whole is so recent that we are unable to determine whether the numbers are regular. I would wish to know the winter population, as well as the breeding. Whether they come or not is a question which is decided at the boundary, and I find it very interesting to learn what home conditions the little birds enjoy, while at the same time imagining how dreadful, how little notice they get, in our “public” parks.

Yorkshire had been criticised in the press for fielding a weakened line-up against the Natives when the sides first met in December. After the unexpected loss, Yorkshire were determined to make amends and a strong side was selected for the county, including Fred Bonsor, Richard Lockwood and John Willie Sutcliffe, all of whom would appear for England against the Natives later that season.","After an entertaining match, the Natives won 4–3. In February the side played a game between Northern and Durham County, which the Natives won by a 1–1 score line. This match caused some of the Northerners great excitement, and gained much press coverage. The next match for the Natives was against Yorkshire again, this time at Headingley, before travelling to Cheshire to play Macclesfield, before another 3–1 win against Lancashire. However, the win over Lancashire was no longer enough to ensure their success at the home of rugby league.","But, in what was the first time in which a county had won their opening match, it proved a convincing 8–1 victory for the Natives. The game proved to be a highlight of the season, but controversy was aroused when the result was announced and several players had to be sworn to secrecy. Undeterred, the Natives would go on to win the 1889 BARFL Premiership, where the Championship was to be renamed in honour of Wiganer John ""Don"" Brumby.","beam,nucleus",wiki,t5_xxl_descartes,"Text 2.

At Windsor he was agreeable to the Queen from his German tastes and sympathies, not to mention the fact that he could speak German as fluently as English. Every moment of leisure during his ""wait"" there was spent in the Castle library. Yet the position was an unnatural one, and Lord Acton soon became anxious to escape from it. His thoughts turned to his favourite Bavaria, and he humbly suggested the Legation at Stuttgart as a possible sphere. But something infinitely better than any political or diplomatic post remained for this born student and truly learned man. In 1895, just a year after Mr. Gladstone's resignation, Sir John Seeley, Professor of Modern History at Cambridge, departed this life. The Chair was in the gift of the Crown, that is, of the Prime Minister, and Lord Rosebery appointed Lord Acton.

Acton occupied the Chair and the whole atmosphere of the College was changed. In the early days of his appointment the great historian took a more active part in College affairs, although he continued essentially to be an eccentric and reclusive student and teacher. He has often expressed himself in terms of gratitude to his predecessor, Sir John Seeley, as a most unusual and kind man. And the goodwill that Lord Acton received among his students at Cambridge had a permanent bearing on his subsequent career.","Lord Acton had become restless in Windsor and was anxious to find a better sphere.

When the seed of the rice is about to be sown in the nursery or bedding-out ground, where under the wet system of cultivation it is regularly allowed to sprout before being transplanted to the fields, the best grains are picked out to form the Rice-mother. These are then sown in the middle of the bed, and the common seed is planted round about them. The state of the Rice-mother is supposed to exert the greatest influence on the growth of the rice; if she droops or pines away, the harvest will be bad in consequence. The woman who sows the Rice-mother in the nursery lets her hair hang loose and afterwards bathes, as a means of ensuring an abundant harvest.","After the grain has been sown the common seeds are also sown round about the Rice-mother, but so far apart as to exclude her; it is a custom among the farmers to plant her right up to the top of the soil. The Rice-mother is also attended by a special ceremony at the time of harvesting. After the rice has been cut, and the last ripe grains have been gathered, the head is shorn, and the grains that are eaten are placed in a dark-colored container as a remembrance of the Rice-mother.","The same females as before are sometimes entrusted with the responsibility of shearing the rice, and such in return are granted a bountiful harvest.

In 2005, University of Colorado Boulder administrators ordered an investigation into seven allegations of research misconduct, including three allegations of plagiarism, and four allegations of fabrication or falsification regarding the history of the Dawes Act, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, and repeated claims that smallpox was intentionally spread to Native Americans by John Smith in 1614 and by the United States Army at Fort Clark in 1837. On May 16, 2006 the University released their findings; the Investigative Committee unanimously concluded that Churchill had engaged in ""serious research misconduct"", including falsification, fabrication, and two of the three allegations of plagiarism. The committee was divided on the appropriate level of sanctions. The Standing Committee on Research Misconduct accepted the findings of the Investigative Committee but also disagreed on what sanctions should be imposed. Churchill's appeal against his proposed dismissal was considered by a panel of the University's Privilege and Tenure Committee, which found that two of the seven findings of misconduct did not constitute dismissible offenses.","However, Churchill's conduct continued to warrant discipline and he received a 14-month suspension with a reduction in his annual salary. Churchill was denied tenure and dismissed from the university. In November 2006, Churchill sought a similar suspension in his case against the University of California San Diego, which was later rejected. Churchill continued to appeal the University's decision to dismiss his case, arguing that the panel had failed to clearly define the term ""dismissible offense"", and that the penalty suggested by the Privilege and Tenure Committee was unreasonable and potentially discriminatory.","On November 9, 2006, the panel announced its decision that Churchill would be given a two-year leave of absence from his position as a full professor at the University of Colorado.

It is indeed the temptation of all talent to subordinate things to itself and not itself to things; to conquer for the sake of conquest, and to put self-love in the place of conscience. Talent is glad enough, no doubt, to triumph in a good cause; but it easily becomes a free lance, content, whatever the cause, so long as victory follows its banner. I do not know even whether success in a weak and bad cause is not the most flattering for talent, which then divides the honors of its triumph with nothing and no one.

A man has the intellect; he is not alone without talent. For a man's intellect is like a hand; to hold it in order to use it, one needs talent, a hand that can grasp and grasp. Without the art of grasping, the hand is like a valet's. Without the art of grasping, the hand is like a servant. A man with an honest mind needs a lively hand, a good hand.","Talent can pervert the course of truth, and can even, in a manner, take the truth as a positive end; but it cannot make it its goal. Love of truth, on the other hand, is truly objective; it finds truth wherever truth is found. But in contrast with talent, which is the spear which throws the shaft of truth, love of truth is the defense of truth; it is the shield which counteracts talent and protects it from the adversaries of its triumph.
