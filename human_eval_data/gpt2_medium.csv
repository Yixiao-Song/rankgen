Acting on a report in January 2009, the city council recommended that B of the Bang should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe reinstatement. The report recognised the sculpture's aesthetic value for Manchester and Manchester City Council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a long-term solution. One possibility involved the replacement of the steel spikes with alternatives made from carbon fibre, although the report underlined the necessity for extensive testing. In January 2009, Antony Gormley, creator of the Angel of the North—to which B of the Bang is often compared—spoke out in support of the sculpture, stating that, ""It is a great tribute to Manchester that this ground-breaking work was commissioned. To allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of the council's nerve.""","On 26 June 2009, after receiving support from the museum and a growing number of local community members, a committee of five retired, civil service, professional and arts professionals was appointed to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment of B of the Bang. A report entitled, Manchester: an Urban City and a Public Space, released on 26 December 2009, concluded that the sculpture's design and its aesthetic value were a primary concern.","Gormley also stated that the sculpture's aesthetic value would likely go down with the installation. He suggested that, while it had not been approved by any council, a group of artists in the area had been working hard to create new designs for its replacement. In May 2010, it emerged that a design group had received £40,000 to design a replacement to the sculpture. These designs are currently being discussed with potential purchasers. In June 2010, the city council announced that it was working towards a £30,000 commitment to the sculpture.","nucleus,beam",wiki,gpt2_medium,"Text 2 - Gormley is quoted at the end of context text, so it makes sense that 'Gormley also stated' would follow the context quote.",off-prompt - flow,

The Curators of the Parks, not less generous to the birds than to mankind, have provided vast stores of food for the former, in the numbers of birches and conifers which flourish under their care. They, or their predecessors who stocked the plantations, seem to have had the particular object of attracting those delightful little north-country birds the Lesser Redpolls, for they have planted every kind of tree in whose seeds they find a winter subsistence. Whether they come every winter I am unable to say, and am inclined to doubt it; but in 1884, any one who went the round of the Parks, keeping an eye on the birches, could hardly fail to see them, and they have been reported not only as taking refuge here in the winter, but even as nesting in the summer. A nest was taken from the branch of a fir-tree here in 1883, and in this present year, if I am not mistaken, another nest was built.","I have not seen it, but it would be hard to imagine that some of the Lesser Redpolls might be more likely to lay eggs under such circumstances.

He uses historical photographs as source material for works. In the early 1990s at Santa Fe Indian Market, Churchill protested the passage of the 1990 Indian Arts and Crafts Act. It requires that, to identify and exhibit works as being by a Native American, artists and craftsmen must be enrolled in a Native American tribe or designated by a tribe as an artisan. Under federal law, Churchill cannot identify his art as by a Native American. Some of Churchill's pieces may infringe copyrights.

Mails Churchill printed 150 copies of Winter Attack and sold at least one of them. Other copies are available online for purchase.","During an October 2004 speech on American Indian Arts and Crafts, Churchill claimed that Native American artist David A. Walker (1874-1940) was actually inspired by a painting by Walker by Native American artist Joseph E. Matson, which he described as ""a simple and effective metaphor for our ongoing struggle against the genocide of Indigenous Peoples"" by the federal government, which he claims ""is the main driver behind the current anti-Native Arts Act."" This speech is quoted in the text.","Churchill said he purchased about a dozen copies of Winter Attack in 2007. Although he did not purchase copies to sell, Churchill told this writer that he made copies of the painting for personal use and for friends, then gave the paintings away.

Due to concerns about possible government infiltration by Scientologists, applicants for civil service positions in Bavaria are required to declare whether or not they are Scientologists, and a similar policy has been instituted in Hesse. Companies tendering for government contracts were likewise required to state they are not Scientologists; in 2001, this requirement was changed, and firms are now asked to sign a form stating that ""the technology of L. Ron Hubbard will not be used in executing the contract"".

At one point, Eno had the tapes cued up and ready to be recorded over, but this erasure never took place; according to engineer Flood, fellow engineer Pat McCarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing Eno ready to erase the tapes, dropped the tray of tea he was carrying and physically restrained Eno. The studio version of the song was compiled from several different takes. It was one of several songs mixed by Steve Lillywhite in the final months of recording The Joshua Tree. Drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. later said of the song, ""It took so long to get that song right, it was difficult for us to make any sense of it.

He also adds a couple of ""songs"" at the end of the song.","And playing the first show, it was such a joy to get up onstage and play that song.""

She was not in that time a very great Christian country, a great Protestant country, and yet it did not at once become a Protestant state. The Reformation happened at a time when Protestantism was on its way to the highest stage.","To this point I am almost at a loss.

He cited constitutional reasons for his refusal, but more probably, his reasons were political. The Democrats were dominant in the region, and he wanted to avoid challenging his own party. By collecting some old US Civil War debts from the federal government, Beckham also virtually eliminated the state's debt. Encouraged by the state's improved finances, the General Assembly voted to expand two of the state's normal schools: Western State Teachers College in Bowling Green (later Western Kentucky University) and Eastern State Teachers College in Richmond (later part of Eastern Kentucky University). With a successful legislative session behind him, Beckham made a bold political move in June 1906. He orchestrated an effort to set the Democratic gubernatorial and senatorial primaries in November, a full year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the senatorial election. Beckham wanted the Senate seat, and if the primary was moved up two years, he could secure his party's nomination while he was still governor.","He convinced a Democratic senator named George W. Johnson to support the move. Johnson, who had represented West Virginia since 1910, refused to join Beckham's push and instead voted against moving the Senate primaries into November and said he would prefer the two houses continue to hold general elections, where Democrats would hold control. In August 1906, two months before the Democrats moved to nominate Johnson, Beckham asked General Superintendent of Public Instruction Henry L. Williams to postpone the primary until April 1907. The result was a near tie for the state Senate seat.","But the Republican Party was still heavily represented, and if it lost the governor's primary, it might face the same fate as Southern Republicans had to endure during the Republican Reconstruction Era. The Democrats' advantage in the statewide primary elections, combined with the fact that Democrats had the greater number of senators and a greater number of gubernatorial seats in 1906, meant that the General Assembly's Republicans had a better shot at the general election.

Plans were underway to renovate the Threefoot Building, but newly elected Mayor Cheri Barry killed the plans in early 2010. Today, the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops, restaurants, and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night. The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events, and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown. Given Meridian's site as a railroad junction, its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels. Even before Meridian reached its ""Golden Age,"" several large hotels, including the Great Southern and the Grand Avenue hotels, were built before the start of the 20th century. With the growth of the railroads and the construction of the original Union Station in 1906, many hotels were constructed for passengers and workers. The Elmira Hotel was constructed in 1905, and the Terminal Hotel was constructed in 1910.","The city's most popular hotel, the Four Seasons, opened in 1915 and remained in operation for over half a century. The Three Foot Building at Meridian was originally used for lodging until the 1940s. By 1948, it became a hotel; it was the first major hotel to replace its former roof after World War II. Today the hotel serves as an important landmark on downtown Meridian. Aerial photos taken in 2007 show the Three Foot Building as seen from Downtown Meridian Street, in the north section of the Meridian Main Street building.","The Alliance also provides funding for activities including the building of the Main Street Bridge, the new downtown hotel, the downtown streetcar, the Meridian Streetcar, and other transportation needs downtown. In addition, the Alliance provides support for other civic organizations including: For example, the Meridian Volunteer Fire Department was established as an emergency response team during the Great Depression and its volunteers have performed more than 1 million rescues since 1930. It is estimated that as many as 10,000 volunteers are employed by the Fire Department each year.","beam,nucleus",wiki,gpt2_medium,"Text 1 - This is a clear continuation of the text about the hotels in the area, and the timeline for their building.",off-prompt - flow,

Victoria was subsequently used for patrol duties and logistic support, although a number of personnel were involved in actions against Māori fortifications. One sailor died from an accidental gunshot wound during the deployment. In late 1863, the New Zealand government requested troops to assist in the invasion of the Waikato province against the Māori. Promised settlement on confiscated land, more than 2,500 Australians (over half of whom were from Victoria) were recruited to form four Waikato Regiments. Other Australians became scouts in the Company of Forest Rangers. Despite experiencing arduous conditions the Australians were not heavily involved in battle, and were primarily used for patrolling and garrison duties. Australians were involved in actions at Matarikoriko, Pukekohe East, Titi Hill, Ōrākau and Te Ranga. Fewer than 20 were believed to have been killed in action.","The war of 1864-65 saw a significant reduction in Australian involvement, as all troops were returned to the Pacific Islands and the Māori returned to their traditional homeland. On the morning of 18 November 1864, two Australians were found strangled near a house in the Wālau suburb, Pōheke, Māori occupied Waikato. The bodies of William Dreyfus and Thomas O'Donnell were found by the Waikato coroner, who later identified their killer as a French-born Māori woman.","The war in Taranaki was to continue into the early 1870s. In January 1872, Victoria was again sent to Taranaki by New Zealand. In March 1872, Victoria was again sent to the Waikato province by New Zealand.

But when we become more sensitive by a constant use of abstract forms (which have no material interpretation) it will become of great practical significance. And so as art becomes more difficult, its wealth of expression in form becomes greater and greater. At the same time the question of distortion in drawing falls out and is replaced by the question how far the inner appeal of the particular form is veiled or given full expression. And once more the possibilities are extended, for combinations of veiled and fully expressed appeals suggest new LEITMOTIVEN in composition. Without such development as this, form-composition is impossible. To anyone who cannot experience the inner appeal of form (whether material or abstract) such composition can never be other than meaningless. Apparently aimless alterations in form-arrangement will make art seem merely a game. So once more we are faced with the same principle, which is to set art free, the principle of the inner need.","But this necessity in art is expressed not only by change of form. For the inner appeal of form can only come to us as a result of an increasing awareness of our inner needs. But if we have no inner needs this awareness can never increase our inner freedom, nor do we have to take away any of our existing needs, for they are always present as well. Only the increasing consciousness of our needs can ever bring about a change of form-arrangement in art. And thus to find freedom is to find a new inner freedom.","This means that in the pursuit of art-making one must be open to new situations, to new points of view and to new ways of working. It means that the aim of a composition must not be always its sole interest, that it must always be free of anything concrete, and only this free activity should be considered as its object.","beam,nucleus",pg19,gpt2_medium,"Text 2 - It could really be either, but I feel Text 2 follows more closely, Text 1 I feel is more related to the artist's feelings, and Text 2 more to the art, which matches more closely to the context text in my opinion.",off-prompt - less relevant,

Further up the eastern side there is a large cirque with a small tarn. There are also lakes to both the north and south, Turquoise and Twin Lakes respectively; the Twin Lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines, and Turquoise Lake was created by the manmade Sugar Loaf Dam. Mount Elbert is composed largely of quartzite. However, the summit ridge consists of metamorphic basement rock, which is Pre-Cambrian in origin and about 1.7 billion years old. There are various igneous intrusions including pegmatite, as well as bands of gneiss and schist. Unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere, Elbert lacks both a permanent snowpack and a prominent north-facing cirque, which can be attributed to its position among other mountains of similar height, causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation.","Geology The Elbert is a subplate of the North American tectonic plate, as shown in Figure 1. The plate is of very low tectonic activity (as shown by the blue arrow in Figure 1A) that has largely stalled for most of the last 200 million years. The North American Plate was introduced into the New York area by volcanic activity in the late Jurassic Period. The plate is about 1-2 miles thick, and consists mainly of a large mass of continental material (mainly rocks and ash).","In contrast, the base of Mount Elbert receives a constant influx of water from the Gulf Stream. The elevation of Mount Elbert is in fact relatively stable: in the northern part of the summit, the elevations are slightly below the average of other peaks within the valley.

This so-called Mother of Rice is the occasion of a number of ceremonies observed at the planting and harvesting of the rice as well as during its preservation in the barn. When the seed of the rice is about to be sown in the nursery or bedding-out ground, where under the wet system of cultivation it is regularly allowed to sprout before being transplanted to the fields, the best grains are picked out to form the Rice-mother. These are then sown in the middle of the bed, and the common seed is planted round about them. The state of the Rice-mother is supposed to exert the greatest influence on the growth of the rice; if she droops or pines away, the harvest will be bad in consequence. The woman who sows the Rice-mother in the nursery lets her hair hang loose and afterwards bathes, as a means of ensuring an abundant harvest.","If the Rice-mother is kept in the nursery, the sowing of the seed is usually performed by the children who gather the rice and set it out on the floor, from the mother's room to her crib.

Wickliffe, served as governor of Louisiana. Beckham obtained his early education at Roseland Academy in Bardstown. In 1881, he served as a page in the Kentucky House of Representatives at 12. Later, he enrolled at Central University (now Eastern Kentucky University) in Richmond, Kentucky but was forced to quit school at 17 to support his widowed mother. Two years later, he became principal of Bardstown public schools, from 1888 to 1893.

While at Kentucky, he was a member of the Supreme Court of Kentucky and served as vice president of that court. During this period he was also vice president of the Kentucky Republican party. After completing law school, he worked in a bank and served for several years as treasurer. He left Kentucky in 1895 to serve as chairman of the board of trustees at Central.","From 1894 to 1900, he practiced law in Louisville.

His method of drawing is immature; its variations from the ordinary result from lack of capacity. Two examples will make my meaning clearer. The child draws a landscape. His picture contains one or two objects only from the number before his eyes. These are the objects which strike him as important. So far, good. But there is no relation between them; they stand isolated on his paper, mere lumpish shapes. The Post-Impressionist, however, selects his objects with a view to expressing by their means the whole feeling of the landscape. His choice falls on elements which sum up the whole, not those which first attract immediate attention. Again, let us take the case of the definitely religious picture. [Footnote: Religion, in the sense of awe, is present in all true art. But here I use the term in the narrower sense to mean pictures of which the subject is connected with Christian or other worship.] It is not often that children draw religious scenes.","They are more apt to draw such pictures as do not relate to religion. But for religious objects in general and for Christian pictures in particular, there would be great difficulty in drawing. In the first place, there is the difficulty of making an object which is not religious; so far the objects are too simple for that purpose. In the second place, the drawing of such pictures frequently fails to convey any sense of religious feeling in the viewer; so far the object is not sufficiently connected with the feeling. Now, the child's choice here is correct in this respect.","Such is not always the case in painting, and it is not always the case in the case of other pictures. The picture of a woman in a church of the Virgin Mary, for instance, can never be drawn by an artist of this sort. This is true of almost all religious pictures, and it must also be true of every picture of God. The same is true of the picture of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

But when we become more sensitive by a constant use of abstract forms (which have no material interpretation) it will become of great practical significance. And so as art becomes more difficult, its wealth of expression in form becomes greater and greater. At the same time the question of distortion in drawing falls out and is replaced by the question how far the inner appeal of the particular form is veiled or given full expression. And once more the possibilities are extended, for combinations of veiled and fully expressed appeals suggest new LEITMOTIVEN in composition. Without such development as this, form-composition is impossible. To anyone who cannot experience the inner appeal of form (whether material or abstract) such composition can never be other than meaningless. Apparently aimless alterations in form-arrangement will make art seem merely a game. So once more we are faced with the same principle, which is to set art free, the principle of the inner need.","But this necessity in art is expressed not only by change of form. For the inner appeal of form can only come to us as a result of an increasing awareness of our inner needs. But if we have no inner needs this awareness can never increase our inner freedom, nor do we have to take away any of our existing needs, for they are always present as well. Only the increasing consciousness of our needs can ever bring about a change of form-arrangement in art. And thus to find freedom is to find a new inner freedom.","This means that in the pursuit of art-making one must be open to new situations, to new points of view and to new ways of working.

He cited constitutional reasons for his refusal, but more probably, his reasons were political. The Democrats were dominant in the region, and he wanted to avoid challenging his own party. By collecting some old US Civil War debts from the federal government, Beckham also virtually eliminated the state's debt. Encouraged by the state's improved finances, the General Assembly voted to expand two of the state's normal schools: Western State Teachers College in Bowling Green (later Western Kentucky University) and Eastern State Teachers College in Richmond (later part of Eastern Kentucky University). With a successful legislative session behind him, Beckham made a bold political move in June 1906. He orchestrated an effort to set the Democratic gubernatorial and senatorial primaries in November, a full year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the senatorial election. Beckham wanted the Senate seat, and if the primary was moved up two years, he could secure his party's nomination while he was still governor.","He convinced a Democratic senator named George W. Johnson to support the move. Johnson, who had represented West Virginia since 1910, refused to join Beckham's push and instead voted against moving the Senate primaries into November and said he would prefer the two houses continue to hold general elections, where Democrats would hold control. In August 1906, two months before the Democrats moved to nominate Johnson, Beckham asked General Superintendent of Public Instruction Henry L. Williams to postpone the primary until April 1907. The result was a near tie for the state Senate seat.","But the Republican Party was still heavily represented, and if it lost the governor's primary, it might face the same fate as Southern Republicans had to endure during the Republican Reconstruction Era. The Democrats' advantage in the statewide primary elections, combined with the fact that Democrats had the greater number of senators and a greater number of gubernatorial seats in 1906, meant that the General Assembly's Republicans had a better shot at the general election.

His method of drawing is immature; its variations from the ordinary result from lack of capacity. Two examples will make my meaning clearer. The child draws a landscape. His picture contains one or two objects only from the number before his eyes. These are the objects which strike him as important. So far, good. But there is no relation between them; they stand isolated on his paper, mere lumpish shapes. The Post-Impressionist, however, selects his objects with a view to expressing by their means the whole feeling of the landscape. His choice falls on elements which sum up the whole, not those which first attract immediate attention. Again, let us take the case of the definitely religious picture. [Footnote: Religion, in the sense of awe, is present in all true art. But here I use the term in the narrower sense to mean pictures of which the subject is connected with Christian or other worship.] It is not often that children draw religious scenes.","They are more apt to draw such pictures as do not relate to religion. But for religious objects in general and for Christian pictures in particular, there would be great difficulty in drawing. In the first place, there is the difficulty of making an object which is not religious; so far the objects are too simple for that purpose. In the second place, the drawing of such pictures frequently fails to convey any sense of religious feeling in the viewer; so far the object is not sufficiently connected with the feeling. Now, the child's choice here is correct in this respect.","Such is not always the case in painting, and it is not always the case in the case of other pictures. The picture of a woman in a church of the Virgin Mary, for instance, can never be drawn by an artist of this sort. This is true of almost all religious pictures, and it must also be true of every picture of God. The same is true of the picture of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

He uses historical photographs as source material for works. In the early 1990s at Santa Fe Indian Market, Churchill protested the passage of the 1990 Indian Arts and Crafts Act. It requires that, to identify and exhibit works as being by a Native American, artists and craftsmen must be enrolled in a Native American tribe or designated by a tribe as an artisan. Under federal law, Churchill cannot identify his art as by a Native American. Some of Churchill's pieces may infringe copyrights. For example, his 1981 serigraph Winter Attack was, according to Churchill and others, based on a 1972 drawing by the artist Thomas E. Mails Churchill printed 150 copies of Winter Attack and sold at least one of them. Other copies are available online for purchase.","During an October 2004 speech on American Indian Arts and Crafts, Churchill claimed that Native American artist David A. Walker (1874-1940) was actually inspired by a painting by Walker by Native American artist Joseph E. Matson, which he described as ""a simple and effective metaphor for our ongoing struggle against the genocide of Indigenous Peoples"" by the federal government, which he claims ""is the main driver behind the current anti-Native Arts Act."" This speech is quoted in the text.","Churchill said he purchased about a dozen copies of Winter Attack in 2007.

The intent was that these troops would wade across the channel (now known as Breach Inlet) between Long and Sullivan's, which the British believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so, while the fleet bombarded Fort Sullivan. General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions. He began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston. He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an avenue of retreat for the fort's garrison, but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile (1.6 km) channel separating the island from Charleston; the unwillingness of Moultrie and Rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role. The Americans also constructed an entrenchment at the northern end of Sullivan's Island, which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons, and began to fortify a guard post at Haddrell's Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan.","For the final two weeks of the campaign, Clinton and Lee crossed the channel by land on Long Island while reinforcing their defensive positions along the shore.

At one point, Eno had the tapes cued up and ready to be recorded over, but this erasure never took place; according to engineer Flood, fellow engineer Pat McCarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing Eno ready to erase the tapes, dropped the tray of tea he was carrying and physically restrained Eno. The studio version of the song was compiled from several different takes. It was one of several songs mixed by Steve Lillywhite in the final months of recording The Joshua Tree.

He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices, a reform that both he and Goebel had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign.

Although the Kentucky Constitution prohibited governors from serving consecutive terms, Beckham announced that he would seek a full term as governor in 1903.

Beckham won by nearly fifty percent over St. Clair, the only Republican in the state Senate and a Republican governor in his day.

At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public, and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed. As a result, some of the joints were re-welded, with equipment put in place to prevent excessive movement. This consisted of retrofitting tip weights to 70% of the spikes' weights. Despite these modifications, B of the Bang remained fenced off, prompting a local newspaper campaign to 'Get It Sorted'. In May 2006 a total of nine spikes were removed from the sculpture and taken away for metallurgical analysis, to discover the stresses being placed on the steel. It was announced in October 2007 that Manchester City Council were taking legal action against the makers of the sculpture, with the aim of completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture. In November 2008 this culminated in an out-of-court settlement being reached between Manchester City Council, the project's designers Thomas Heatherwick Studio Ltd, and the engineering and construction subcontractors Packman Lucas Ltd, Flint and Neill Partnership and Westbury Structures Ltd.","On 17 December 2008, following a hearing at Manchester City Council, a court judgment was recorded and the sculpture was opened to the public once more. The public were offered tours of the sculpture on this date, and the sculpture was restored.","The settlement was designed to ensure the maintenance of the sculpture and ensure the safety of the public. The work carried out to complete the repairs, which included reinforcing the centre of the steel with additional steel plates, required approximately £35,000 of City Council funds to carry out.

She was not in that time a very great Christian country, a great Protestant country, and yet it did not at once become a Protestant state. The Reformation happened at a time when Protestantism was on its way to the highest stage.","To this point I am almost at a loss.

The effect on the viewer is different, he cannot see the difference. The idea is quite different. It is for the coloured wall, or for the whole structure in which they exist, to change colour. This is the true origin of the difference between black and white; it is the change that the human eye takes from one colour to another.","Van Gogh is thus far on the side of the impressionists in this respect.] In the art of painting the white is usually not placed at the centre of the composition, but at the angle indicated by the background colour (or in fact, even the colours which stand between the colors). But the centre can be given more or less, and this is where the great difficulty lies. Even if all the elements, which give the idea of white, can be removed, the idea remains.","nucleus,beam",pg19,gpt2_medium,Text 2. Text 2 finishes the footnote that began in the paragraph.

He uses historical photographs as source material for works. In the early 1990s at Santa Fe Indian Market, Churchill protested the passage of the 1990 Indian Arts and Crafts Act. It requires that, to identify and exhibit works as being by a Native American, artists and craftsmen must be enrolled in a Native American tribe or designated by a tribe as an artisan. Under federal law, Churchill cannot identify his art as by a Native American. Some of Churchill's pieces may infringe copyrights. For example, his 1981 serigraph Winter Attack was, according to Churchill and others, based on a 1972 drawing by the artist Thomas E. Mails Churchill printed 150 copies of Winter Attack and sold at least one of them. Other copies are available online for purchase.","During an October 2004 speech on American Indian Arts and Crafts, Churchill claimed that Native American artist David A. Walker (1874-1940) was actually inspired by a painting by Walker by Native American artist Joseph E. Matson, which he described as ""a simple and effective metaphor for our ongoing struggle against the genocide of Indigenous Peoples"" by the federal government, which he claims ""is the main driver behind the current anti-Native Arts Act."" This speech is quoted in the text.","Churchill said he purchased about a dozen copies of Winter Attack in 2007. Although he did not purchase copies to sell, Churchill told this writer that he made copies of the painting for personal use and for friends, then gave the paintings away.

But when we become more sensitive by a constant use of abstract forms (which have no material interpretation) it will become of great practical significance. And so as art becomes more difficult, its wealth of expression in form becomes greater and greater. At the same time the question of distortion in drawing falls out and is replaced by the question how far the inner appeal of the particular form is veiled or given full expression. And once more the possibilities are extended, for combinations of veiled and fully expressed appeals suggest new LEITMOTIVEN in composition. Without such development as this, form-composition is impossible. To anyone who cannot experience the inner appeal of form (whether material or abstract) such composition can never be other than meaningless. Apparently aimless alterations in form-arrangement will make art seem merely a game. So once more we are faced with the same principle, which is to set art free, the principle of the inner need.","But this necessity in art is expressed not only by change of form. For the inner appeal of form can only come to us as a result of an increasing awareness of our inner needs. But if we have no inner needs this awareness can never increase our inner freedom, nor do we have to take away any of our existing needs, for they are always present as well. Only the increasing consciousness of our needs can ever bring about a change of form-arrangement in art.

Further up the eastern side there is a large cirque with a small tarn. There are also lakes to both the north and south, Turquoise and Twin Lakes respectively; the Twin Lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines, and Turquoise Lake was created by the manmade Sugar Loaf Dam. Mount Elbert is composed largely of quartzite. However, the summit ridge consists of metamorphic basement rock, which is Pre-Cambrian in origin and about 1.7 billion years old. There are various igneous intrusions including pegmatite, as well as bands of gneiss and schist. Unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere, Elbert lacks both a permanent snowpack and a prominent north-facing cirque, which can be attributed to its position among other mountains of similar height, causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation.","Geology The Elbert is a subplate of the North American tectonic plate, as shown in Figure 1. The plate is of very low tectonic activity (as shown by the blue arrow in Figure 1A) that has largely stalled for most of the last 200 million years. The North American Plate was introduced into the New York area by volcanic activity in the late Jurassic Period. The plate is about 1-2 miles thick, and consists mainly of a large mass of continental material (mainly rocks and ash).","In contrast, the base of Mount Elbert receives a constant influx of water from the Gulf Stream. The elevation of Mount Elbert is in fact relatively stable: in the northern part of the summit, the elevations are slightly below the average of other peaks within the valley.

Whether they come every winter I am unable to say, and am inclined to doubt it; but in 1884, any one who went the round of the Parks, keeping an eye on the birches, could hardly fail to see them, and they have been reported not only as taking refuge here in the winter, but even as nesting in the summer. A nest was taken from the branch of a fir-tree here in 1883, and in this present year, if I am not mistaken, another nest was built.","I have not seen it, but it would be hard to imagine that some of the Lesser Redpolls might be more likely to lay eggs under such circumstances. I pass over this park again to the Great Exhibition Grounds; here I saw three species of Redpoll, and saw the first instance of their being collected in sufficient quantity, and in good form, to be ready for the distribution.","I remember at a time that, having seen a little nest on one of the trees, we were so disturbed that I forgot that we had just entered the Parks, and looked round, and seeing none, returned home, and saw a number of little crows, all of them on the branches of the trees; so that they would have been quite safe from the birds.

One possibility involved the replacement of the steel spikes with alternatives made from carbon fibre, although the report underlined the necessity for extensive testing.

When the seed of the rice is about to be sown in the nursery or bedding-out ground, where under the wet system of cultivation it is regularly allowed to sprout before being transplanted to the fields, the best grains are picked out to form the Rice-mother. These are then sown in the middle of the bed, and the common seed is planted round about them. The state of the Rice-mother is supposed to exert the greatest influence on the growth of the rice; if she droops or pines away, the harvest will be bad in consequence. The woman who sows the Rice-mother in the nursery lets her hair hang loose and afterwards bathes, as a means of ensuring an abundant harvest.","If the Rice-mother is kept in the nursery, the sowing of the seed is usually performed by the children who gather the rice and set it out on the floor, from the mother's room to her crib.

If on their part it was a sordid speculation, to her it had the freshness of the first wooing. If it made of her a mere pawn in their hands, it would put her, so Garnett hoped, beyond farther risk of such base uses; and to achieve this had become a necessity to him. The sense that, if he lost sight of Mr. Newell, the latter might not easily be found again, nerved Garnett to hold his ground in spite of the resistance he encountered; and he tried to put the full force of his plea into the tone with which he cried: ""Ah, you don't know your daughter!""

Victoria was subsequently used for patrol duties and logistic support, although a number of personnel were involved in actions against Māori fortifications. One sailor died from an accidental gunshot wound during the deployment. In late 1863, the New Zealand government requested troops to assist in the invasion of the Waikato province against the Māori. Promised settlement on confiscated land, more than 2,500 Australians (over half of whom were from Victoria) were recruited to form four Waikato Regiments. Other Australians became scouts in the Company of Forest Rangers. Despite experiencing arduous conditions the Australians were not heavily involved in battle, and were primarily used for patrolling and garrison duties. Australians were involved in actions at Matarikoriko, Pukekohe East, Titi Hill, Ōrākau and Te Ranga. Fewer than 20 were believed to have been killed in action.","The war of 1864-65 saw a significant reduction in Australian involvement, as all troops were returned to the Pacific Islands and the Māori returned to their traditional homeland. On the morning of 18 November 1864, two Australians were found strangled near a house in the Wālau suburb, Pōheke, Māori occupied Waikato. The bodies of William Dreyfus and Thomas O'Donnell were found by the Waikato coroner, who later identified their killer as a French-born Māori woman.","The war in Taranaki was to continue into the early 1870s. In January 1872, Victoria was again sent to Taranaki by New Zealand. In March 1872, Victoria was again sent to the Waikato province by New Zealand.

He cited constitutional reasons for his refusal, but more probably, his reasons were political. The Democrats were dominant in the region, and he wanted to avoid challenging his own party. By collecting some old US Civil War debts from the federal government, Beckham also virtually eliminated the state's debt. Encouraged by the state's improved finances, the General Assembly voted to expand two of the state's normal schools: Western State Teachers College in Bowling Green (later Western Kentucky University) and Eastern State Teachers College in Richmond (later part of Eastern Kentucky University). With a successful legislative session behind him, Beckham made a bold political move in June 1906. He orchestrated an effort to set the Democratic gubernatorial and senatorial primaries in November, a full year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the senatorial election. Beckham wanted the Senate seat, and if the primary was moved up two years, he could secure his party's nomination while he was still governor.","He convinced a Democratic senator named George W. Johnson to support the move. Johnson, who had represented West Virginia since 1910, refused to join Beckham's push and instead voted against moving the Senate primaries into November and said he would prefer the two houses continue to hold general elections, where Democrats would hold control. In August 1906, two months before the Democrats moved to nominate Johnson, Beckham asked General Superintendent of Public Instruction Henry L. Williams to postpone the primary until April 1907. The result was a near tie for the state Senate seat.","But the Republican Party was still heavily represented, and if it lost the governor's primary, it might face the same fate as Southern Republicans had to endure during the Republican Reconstruction Era. The Democrats' advantage in the statewide primary elections, combined with the fact that Democrats had the greater number of senators and a greater number of gubernatorial seats in 1906, meant that the General Assembly's Republicans had a better shot at the general election. Beckham knew it would be close, but he wasn't prepared to risk it by making a political decision he could not influence.","beam,nucleus",wiki,gpt2_medium,"Text 1; Text 1 appears to connect directly to the Context.
